# React Hot Loader @next + Typescript

The workflow here may be overkill or some parts may be unnecessary because it utilizes both `babel-loader` and `react-hot-loader/webpack`.

## Installation

`yarn install`

`yarn run start`

`npm start` and `yarn run start` both point to the local node_modules installation of webpack-dev-server.  If you prefer running it globally, update the start command in `package.json` or start it with `webpack-dev-server` at a prompt.
